# household_power_consumption
# Context: Measurements of electric power consumption in one household with a one-minute sampling rate over a period of almost 4 years. Different electrical quantities and some sub-metering values are available

This archive contains 2075259 measurements gathered between December 2006 and November 2010 (47 months). Notes: 1.(globalactivepower*1000/60 - submetering1 - submetering2 - submetering3) represents the active energy consumed every minute (in watt hour) in the household by electrical equipment not measured in sub-meterings 1, 2 and 3.

2.The dataset contains some missing values in the measurements (nearly 1,25% of the rows). All calendar timestamps are present in the dataset but for some timestamps, the measurement values are missing: a missing value is represented by the absence of value between two consecutive semi-colon attribute separators. For instance, the dataset shows missing values on April 28, 2007.
